# Huffman-coding-algorithm-for-text-compression
It is an algorithm project for text compression.
Loss-less data compression.
Using huffman coding algorithm.
Compression is useful because it reduces resources required to store and transmit data. Computational resources are consumed in the compression process and, usually, in the reversal of the process (decompression). So an efficient way to compress and decompress is necessary for increased efficiency.
## Motivation
Data compression finds its applications everywhere - easing data transfer, file encryption, and many more. Data compression involves encoding information using fewer bits than original representation.
## Objective
The main designing technique used in Compression algorithms is greedy. We will try to lay emphasis on Lossless compression algorithms. The two main algorithms in this category are LZW ,PDLZW and LZSS .Also a trivial greedy algorithm  Huffman coding comes to help.
The main aim will be to implement these algorithms and also try decrease the space and time complexity of the final implemented technique.
We have also tested the algorithm on three types of varying sizes text file.
